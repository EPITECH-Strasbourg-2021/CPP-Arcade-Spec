# C++ Module: Arcade Protocol Specification

This document covers the interfaces and the protocol between the Graphics libraries and the Game libraries in the context of the EPITECH C++ Arcade project.

If you are going to implement this specification, please pay attention to not modify any class or enum names and to keep those under the "Arcade" namespace.

## Entry Point
Your function for the entry point of the library must be named `entryPoint`

## Utilities

The protocol will be referring to a few primitives for representing things like Vectors and Colors.  
This section describes their prototypes.

## Graphic Library / Game Library interoperability

This sections describes objects that will be common for both the graphics libraries and the game libraries.

***Files:** [PixelBox.hpp](https://github.com/EPITECH-Strasbourg-2021/CPP-Arcade-Spec/blob/master/PixelBox.hpp) / [TextBox.hpp](https://github.com/EPITECH-Strasbourg-2021/CPP-Arcade-Spec/blob/master/TextBox.hpp)*


## Graphics Libraries

This section describes the API that each graphics library should inherit, implement and expose.

***Files:** [IGraphicLib.hpp](https://github.com/EPITECH-Strasbourg-2021/CPP-Arcade-Spec/blob/master/IGraphicLib.hpp)*


## Game Libraries

This section describes the API that each game library should inherit, implement and expose.

***Files:** [IGameLib.hpp](https://github.com/EPITECH-Strasbourg-2021/CPP-Arcade-Spec/blob/master/IGameLib.hpp)*
